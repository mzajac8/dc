# Keybindings

Switch between chats: `alt + arrow down`, `alt + arrow up`

Scroll active chat into view ~~`alt + arrow left`~~ _(disabled until we find a better key combo, because this one collides with to mac system shortcut to move a word (see [#1796](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-desktop/issues/1796)))_

Search contact list: `ctrl + k`

Focus message composer: `ctrl + n`

Open settings: `cmd + ,` or `ctrl + ,`

Call MaybeNetwork (can help if deltachat doesn't detect that it is online again after resuming standby): `F5`
